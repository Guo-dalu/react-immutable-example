## React and Immutable.js example

This application demonstrates how React always does a full re-render by default, and how you can change that behavior using `shouldComponentUpdate` and [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/).

Get started:
- Run `npm install`
- Run `gulp`
- Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the build directory

Based on [Flux React Boilerplate](https://github.com/christianalfoni/flux-react-boilerplate).
